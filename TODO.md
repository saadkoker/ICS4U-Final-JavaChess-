- Any concepts you may have to research on your own
- An outline of when you plan to have each component completed

## Part 2: Problem Analysis and Design
- A short explanation of each methods' purpose
- Pseudocode for each method
- ~~Start a work log~~. Each day entering what you have completed, and what you plan to do next.

## Part 3: Implementation
 - Finished "beta" verion of Chess
 
## Part 4: Documentation
